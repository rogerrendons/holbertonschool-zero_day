Git is installed on the iMacs provided by Holberton, but if you’re using
another computer, you might have to [install
it](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/TJrA7MIEl9LxnkGNH_ddmw "install it")
yourself.

-   Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine – they
    will be part of your commits.
    [Tips](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/72jmwYpf2OeuoOn9XM3vQg "Tips")

On
[GitHub.com](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/m27bKy8K40cIkyHWQ36i2w "GitHub.com"):

-   Using the graphic interface on the website, create your first
    repository
    -   Name: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
    -   Description:
        `I'm now a Holberton Student, this is my first repository as a full-stack engineer`
    -   Public repo
    -   No `README`, `.gitignore`, or license

On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:

-   Navigate to your home directory.
    [Tips](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/-odz94uVNOsPV1ovYZLuyw "Tips")
-   Create a directory `holbertonschool-zero_day`.
    [Tips](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/AHYBfU0itf9qEiwLdiaVJw "Tips")
-   Navigate to this new directory.
    [Tips](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/9g9c-qBPHWSGcpxbs69ASw "Tips")
-   Initialize git and add the remote origin
-   Create a file `README.md` with Emacs (or other command line editors)
    and write a small
    [Markdown](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Ru3ANLuzGs4g0v2qsN3efA "Markdown")
    text to present this project. **This file is mandatory in all
    Holberton School projects**
-   Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My
    first commit” and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will
    probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote
    server)

Good job!

You pushed your first file in your **first repository** of the **first
task** of your **first Holberton School project**.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`

`ssh` into your Ubuntu VM. What does the command `uname` print when you
run it without any option?

Type your answer into a file in the `0x00-vagrant` directory and push it
to GitHub. Name your file accordingly as shown below.
