========

** Foundations - 0-Day ― 0-Day

** By Julien Barbier, co-founder & CEO at Holberton School

** Weight: 1

** Project over - took place from 06-01-2020 to 06-03-2020 - you're done with 100% of tasks.

** QA review fully automated.

#### In a nutshell…

-   **Auto QA review:** 35.0/35 mandatory & 0.0/10 optional
-   **Altogether:**  **100.0%**
    -   Mandatory: 100.0%
    -   Optional: 0.0%
    -   Calculation:  100.0% + (100.0% \* 0.0%)  == **100.0%**

Concepts
--------

*For this project, students are expected to look at these concepts:*

-   [Source code management](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/22)
-   [Using Vi as editor](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/55)
-   [Git and Github cheat sheet - Everything in less than 30 seconds](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/57)
-   [The Framework](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/75)
-   [Approaching a Project](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/350)

Resources
---------

**Read or watch**:

-   [Basic vi Commands](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/TvhnXN1GAP7Et5OSuceGqw "Basic vi Commands")

Learning Objectives
-------------------

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/TIOLxjJDcvo85CcmLgsIVA "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What is vi
-   Who is Bill Joy
-   How to start and exit vi
-   What are the command and insert modes, and how to switch from one to the other
-   How to edit text
-   How to cut and paste lines
-   How to search forward and backward
-   How to undo
-   How to quit vi

Requirements
------------

### General

-   Allowed editors: vi
-   A `README.md` file at the root of the `holbertonschool-zero_day` repo, containing a description of the repository
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of *this* project (i.e. `0x02-vi`), describing what this project is about
-   If the answer of one of the following questions needs the `Return` key, then use the string `<Return>`. Example: What is the command to write current contents to a file named in the original vi call? The answer should be exactly `:w<Return>`. Note that there is no space between `w` and `<Return>`
-   Your file should only contain the command, and nothing else
